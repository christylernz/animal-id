# animal-id

Create a simple version of the guess animal game that uses a decision tree to store a distinguishing yes/no question. The result is either an animal or a another distinguishing question. 

The program will ask questions until it reaches an animal node, in which case it will answer with the animal as it's guess.

If the animal is incorrect it will ask for a distinguishing question to identify the animal.

The point of this simple program is to begin understanding expert systems.
