# animal game

Create a simple version of the "guess  the animal game" that uses a decision tree to store a distinguishing yes/no question. The result is either an animal or a another distinguishing question. 

The program will ask questions until it reaches an animal node, in which case it will answer with the animal as it's guess.

If the animal is incorrect it will ask for a distinguishing question to identify the animal.

The point of this simple program is to begin understanding expert systems.

#calculator

Create a calculator application to learn how to create a Web app from start to finish following Behaviour driven development. This is trying to apply some of the reading I've done regarding the topic. It will use jasmine for the test cases initially they will be added manually. In future I may expand this to use automated tests based on the gherkin language.

The process will be to start with a vague statement of the value proposition and then work from there.
